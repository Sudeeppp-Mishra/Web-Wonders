            It's making you cry every time
            You give your love to me this way
            Saying you'd wait for me to stay
            I know it hurts you

            But I need to tell you something
            My heart just can't be faithful for long
            I swear I'll only make you cry

            Maybe I'd change for you someday
            But I can't help the way I feel
            Wish I was good, wish that I could
            Give you my love now

            But I need to tell you something
            My heart just can't be faithful for long
            I swear I'll only make you cry

            I need to tell you something
            My heart just can't be faithful for long
            I swear I'll only make you cry
