    1. <meta charset="UTF-8">

    	•	charset → short for character set
	    •	It tells the browser which character encoding system to use.
	    •	UTF-8 is the most common — it supports letters, symbols, emojis, and almost all languages.

        Think of it like:

        “Hey browser, here’s the dictionary of characters you’ll need to display my page properly!”
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <!--
    2. <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

    	•	http-equiv → acts like an HTTP header instruction for the browser.
	    •	"X-UA-Compatible" is specifically for Internet Explorer (IE) — it tells it to use the latest rendering engine.
	    •	content → gives the value for the instruction above.
	    •	"IE=edge" means use the newest and best version possible of IE’s engine.

        Think of it like:

        “IE, please behave like a modern browser — don’t use old, broken modes!”
    -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

    <!--
    3. <meta name="veiwport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    
    	•	name → gives a label for what kind of information the meta tag provides.
        •	Here it’s "viewport", meaning “information about the screen and display area.”
        •	content → provides the actual settings.
        •	width=device-width → the webpage should match the width of the device (so it looks right on phones, tablets, etc.).
        •	initial-scale=1.0 → sets the zoom level (1.0 means 100%, no zoom in or out).
